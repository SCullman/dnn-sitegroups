	<h3>About the Site Group Editor module</h3>
	<p>SiteGroups allows sharing of users, roles and content between several sites 
	   in one installation of the DNN Platform. This is the missing <b>Editor</b>!</p>
    <p>
	Site Groups (or PortalGroups within the DNN API)  have been introduced to DotNetNuke 6.1, 
	only the Professional Edition came with a editor out of the box. 
	The sharing features are part of the DNN platform, this module only controls their settings.
